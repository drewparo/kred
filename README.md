## Introduction

This repository is the implementation of [KRED: Knowledge-Aware Document Representation for News Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11494)

## Model description

![](./framework.PNG)

KRED is a knowledge enhanced framework which enhance a document embedding with knowledge information for multiple news recommendation tasks. The framework mainly contains two part: representation enhancement part(left) and multi-task training part(right).

##  Data description:

We use [MIND dataset](https://msnews.github.io) in this repo, due to MIND dataset doesn't contain location information, so in this experiments we do not use the local news detection task.

##  Running the code
```
$ python main.py  (this will run KRED for user2item single task training set by default parameters)
```

we also offer a quick example in this notebook: kred_example.ipynb


## Environment
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.10, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):
- numpy==1.19.1
- pytorchtools==0.0.2
- scikit-learn==0.23.2
- scipy==1.5.2
- torch==1.4.0
